# Automated-Mail-Generating
This project is a Python-based browser automation agent designed to automatically login, compose, and send emails using a real email account. The script takes all required inputs (email ID, password, subject, body, receiver) from the command line, launches a browser, automates the full process, and finally sends the email without any manual typing.
